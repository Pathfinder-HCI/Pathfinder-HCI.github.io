        <h1>In-Class Heuristic Eval</h1>
        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p>This mobile app helps you get outside and explore new interesting parts of your area by suggesting paths for you to
        walk.<br>You’re going to help us out by trying to perform a few tasks for us using the interface.<br>This is a prototype, so
        please be as critical as possible so we can make improvements.<br>It was made in Unity and currently does not have all of
        the map/location tracking features, and acts mostly as a demonstration.<br>Remember, we’re testing the interface - not you.
        <br>If you run into problems, it’s not your fault, it means we need to change something.<br>Your cursor acts as your finger and
        you can click to “tap” or “swipe”.<br>Some sections will continue without input to simulate walking on a path.</p>
        <h3>Scenario Tasks</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Leave a rating on a point of interest</li>
            <li>Customize a path by adding a point along the way</li>
            <li>Go on a 20-minute walk</li>
        </ol>
